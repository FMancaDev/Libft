Recreate standard C library functions prefixed with ft_, preserving their prototypes and behavior, including string, memory, character, and dynamic allocation functions:

  - A custom linked list structure (t_list) must be defined.

  - A Makefile should compile all functions into a static library (libft.a).

  - The goal is to build a reusable custom C library matching libc functionality.

Reaching the maximum score demonstrates a strong grasp of these basics, making the transition to future projects much smoother. For anyone preparing for the Common Core, completing this project with 100% is highly recommended! 🚀
